This is the installation file for the EseTools package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building EseTools:

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), v1.0 or later.  Included in
virtually all Linux distros.  Further information is available at
http://www.alsa-project.org/.

Qt6 Toolkit, v6.2 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

BUILD ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


DISTRO-SPECIFIC NOTES
---------------------
1) Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Required build packages: qt6-base-dev make g++ autoconf automake debhelper autoconf-archive pbuilder ubuntu-dev-tools apt-file

Configure script invocation: ./configure --prefix=/usr

Environmental variables:
  DEBUILD_MAKE_ARGS=<optional-gcc-flags>

Due to a bug in the Ubuntu 'qt6-base-dev-tools', it may be necessary to
define the following environmental variable to allow Qt's moc(1) utility
to be found by the build system:

  QT6_MOC=/usr/lib/qt6/libexec/moc


INSTALLATION
------------
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.
